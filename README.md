# Brazilian e-Commerce Transaction 5-star Review Classifier

This project purpose it to develop ML model to classify whether a transaction will resulted in 5-star review or not. This is part of final evaluation for Sharing Vision Data Science Bootcamp that I've done.

## Model Success Criteria
* Recall > 0.7
* Precision > 0.7
* FPR < 0.3

## What to be Seen
* Data preprocessing using Winsorization, Square & Log transformation, OHE, frequency encoding, mutual info feature selection
* Classification model inspected : DT, RF, AdaBoost, XGBoost, SVM.
* Model tuning methods : GridSearch, Sequential, Threshold adjustment

## Datasets
The datasets used were given by bootcamp coordinators, however I also found several datasets which may or may not be used by this dataset as source.
